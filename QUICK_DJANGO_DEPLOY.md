# 🚀 Quick Django Deployment - SAKU Election System

## ❌ **GitHub Pages Problem:**
GitHub Pages only supports static files (HTML/CSS/JS), but our SAKU Election System needs:

- Admin dashboard
- WhatsApp integration

### **Option 2: Fly.io (Free Tier)**

- ✅ **Manual deployment** (but easy)
- ✅ **512MB disk space**

## 🎯 **Recommended: Railway (Let's Fix It)**

Railway is perfect for our Django project. The build failures we had were due to configuration issues, not platform limitations.

### **Why Railway is Best:**

- ✅ **Custom domains** available

3. **Deploy from GitHub** repository
4. **Add environment variables**:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key
   DEBUG=False
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=*.railway.app
   ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBER=+254769582779
   ```
5. **Deploy!** (should work now with fixed config)

## 🎉 **Result:**
- **Full Django backend** with database
- **File uploads** for documents
- **Authentication** system
- **Admin dashboard** with data
