## Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway health check and deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Railway
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway will automatically detect the configuration

### 3. Set Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, add these variables:
```
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key-change-this
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=*.railway.app
ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBER=+254769582779
```

### 4. Health Check Details
- **Endpoint**: `GET /`
- **Expected Response**: JSON with status "healthy"
- **Timeout**: 300 seconds
- **Interval**: 30 seconds
- **Retries**: 10 attempts

## Troubleshooting

### If Health Check Still Fails:

1. **Check Railway Logs**:
   - Go to Railway dashboard

   - Check the "Logs" tab for errors

2. **Common Issues**:
   - Missing environment variables
   - Database connection problems
   - Static files not collected
   - Gunicorn binding issues

3. **Manual Health Check**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/
   ```
   Should return:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "message": "Saku Election System is running",
     "port": "PORT_NUMBER",
     "debug": "False"
   }
   ```
