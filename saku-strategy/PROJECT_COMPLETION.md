- **Real-time Metrics**: Live win score and department coverage
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
- **API Integration**: Seamless backend communication

### 3. **Strategic Features** ✅
- **Win Score Algorithm**: Transparent scoring (0-100) based on coverage and balance
- **What-If Simulator**: Test scenarios before implementing
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify under-covered departments
- **Optimization**: Suggest minimal actions to meet targets
- **Gender Balance**: Configurable per-department requirements
- **Constitutional Compliance**: All rules traceable to specific clauses

### 4. **Documentation & Testing** ✅
- **Comprehensive README**: Setup, usage, API documentation
- **Test Suite**: 13 passing tests covering models, API, analytics
- **Configuration Guide**: How to modify rules and assumptions
- **Docker Setup**: Easy deployment with docker-compose
- **Makefile**: Convenient development commands

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
cd saku-strategy
make dev  # or ./scripts/setup_dev.sh
```

### Access Points
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **Frontend Dashboard**: http://localhost:5173
- **Admin Interface**: http://localhost:8000/admin (admin/admin123)

### Key API Endpoints
- `GET /api/departments/` - List all departments
- `GET /api/delegates/metrics/` - Coverage metrics + win score
- `GET /api/delegates/risks/` - Risk assessment
- `POST /api/delegates/simulate/` - What-if simulation

## 📈 Strategic Value

### For Political Parties
1. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Real-time metrics and scoring
2. **Constitutional Compliance**: Automatic rule validation
3. **Strategic Planning**: What-if simulations and optimization
4. **Risk Management**: Early identification of coverage gaps
5. **Gender Balance**: Ensures fair representation

### For SAKU Elections
1. **Transparency**: All rules traceable to Constitution
2. **Fairness**: Configurable gender balance requirements
3. **Efficiency**: Automated validation and reporting
4. **Accountability**: Audit trail for all decisions

## 🔧 Configuration

### Rules Configuration (`rules/rules.yaml`)
- **Minimum Delegates**: 3 per department (configurable)
- **Gender Balance**: 33% female minimum (configurable)
- **Eligibility Rules**: Year, GPA, disciplinary (extensible)
- **Win Score Weights**: Customizable penalty/bonus system

### Environment Variables
- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: Security key
- `DJANGO_DEBUG`: Development mode
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection

## 🧪 Quality Assurance

### Testing
- **13 Tests Passing**: Models, API, analytics
- **Coverage**: Core functionality tested
- **Validation**: Input sanitization and type checking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure modes

### Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript frontend, Python type hints
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and inline docs
- **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Configurability**: All rules externalized
